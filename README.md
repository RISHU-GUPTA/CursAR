CursAR is an Augmented Reality App developed on Unity 3D with the help of Vuforia Engine.

## About
The student generally feels difficulty in visualizing 2-D Images in the textbooks :orange_book: and results in less attached to that subject. In the App :iphone:, we have tried to bridge the gap between that. We let them visualize effectively and efficiently. Student can interact with the AR Diagram by moving book, Dragging Model, Zooming In & Out, & Rotating it.
 
We currently support Android Platform. We are constantly working around the clock to provide an all-around experience. This is a Minimum Viable Product of our initial thoughts. We will increase functionality and features as per feedback.
